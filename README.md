This is a project given by University of Pristina professor. We have combined source code and our experience to get this done.

In this project is implemented “Base32 encoder and decoder”.
In Python there are not any requirements except that you need to have Python configured in your device and some of the libraries needed for the file to run.

# Language
We have used programming language Python.
This code is open source which people implemented before but we just managed to make changes and make that one work for our needs, so if anyone has problem with it feel free to contact us.
